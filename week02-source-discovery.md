## Exercise Week 02 Exercise 01: Source Discovery

**Chosen Topic:** DraftKings NFL Classic Milly Maker and NFL Showdown (Big Island slates: TNF, SNF, MNF)

### Sources, Discovery Method, and Value Notes

| Source | Discovery Method | Why It Seems Valuable |
|---|---|---|
| [FantasyCruncher Contest Links: NFL 2024 Week 17](https://www.fantasycruncher.com/contest-links/NFL/2024-week-17) | Search engine (Google / DuckDuckGo) | Lets me pull real winning lineups by slate so I can study roster construction patterns across weeks and seasons instead of guessing. |
| 2025 NFL Milly Maker + TNF/SNF/MNF Showdown Winners Dataset (personal tracking) | Self collected dataset | My own tracked results give me a consistent baseline to compare against public sources and test trends across the season. |
| [Title of source](URL) | Expert recommendation (cited by a trusted analyst) |  |
| [Title of source](URL) | Citation chaining (found in references of another source) |  |
| [Title of source](URL) | Community forum (Reddit / specialty forum thread) |  |
| [Title of source](URL) | Social media (YouTube / podcast episode) |  |
| [Run The Sims: NFL SimRunner](https://www.runthesims.com/nfl/premium/simrunner/) | Specialized repository (tool/docs) | Lets me run slate simulations so I can compare outcomes, ownership leverage, and lineup constructions without relying on vibes. This supports Classic Milly decisions around stacks, leverage, and how often certain builds actually win. |
| [The Solver: NFL Optimizer](https://thesolver.com/optimizer/nfl) | Specialized repository (tool/docs) | Gives me a structured way to build lineups using constraints that match how Milly winners are built, such as stacking rules, correlation, and exposure control. It helps turn my strategy into repeatable lineup rules instead of random builds. |
| [Pro Football Focus (PFF)](https://www.pff.com) | News and media (industry publication / data source) | Gives player level grades, matchups, and usage context I can use to justify plays beyond box scores. This is useful for deciding who is actually playing well and where the real edges are for both Classic and Showdown slates. |
| [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) | News and media (industry publication / data source) | Gives historical player, team, and game level stats I can use to validate trends behind Milly winning builds (volume, efficiency, game environment) instead of relying on opinions. |
| [Title of source](URL) | Book or eBook (library catalog / Amazon / Goodreads) | Why it seems valuable. |
