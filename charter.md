## Course Goals

1. Build a clean GitHub repo for CMPA 4301 that stays organized all semester.
2. Learn how to find better sources, judge quality, and document my process instead of relying on random advice.
3. Use Markdown and GitHub to publish work that looks professional and is easy to follow.
4. Apply what I learn to my DFS tracking project (NFL Classic Milly Maker and TNF/SNF/MNF Showdown) so I can improve my decision making and results.

## Potential Challenges

- Getting overwhelmed by tools and features I have not used before.
- Staying consistent week to week when life gets busy.
- Filtering out noisy DFS content and focusing on sources that actually matter.
